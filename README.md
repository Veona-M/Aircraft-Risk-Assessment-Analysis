## Introduction
This project aims to analyze aviation safety data to inform investment decisions for a company expanding into the aviation industry. With a focus on purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, the analysis prioritizes identifying aircraft with the lowest risk to mitigate potential hazards. The findings will be translated into actionable insights for the head of the new aviation division, facilitating informed decisions regarding aircraft selection and purchase.

## Problem Statement
There is interest in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. However, the company lacks knowledge about the potential risks associated with aircraft. The task is to determine which aircraft pose the lowest risk for the company to venture into this new business endeavor. This involves analyzing aviation accident data to identify trends and patterns related to passenger safety, aircraft damage severity, and engine types. The goal is to provide actionable insights that will assist the head of the new aviation division in making informed decisions about which aircraft to purchase.
